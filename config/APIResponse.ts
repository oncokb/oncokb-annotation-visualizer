        'Trametinib is an oral small molecule inhibitor of MEK1/2 that is FDA-approved alone or with dabrafenib for the treatment of patients with metastatic melanoma harboring a V600E or V600K BRAF mutation. In an open-label, randomized Phase III trial, patients with BRAF V600E/K-mutated unresectable, metastatic melanoma received oral trametinib (2 mg once daily) or an intravenous regimen of either dacarbazine (1000 mg/m2) or paclitaxel (175 mg/m2) every three weeks. Trametinib demonstrated improved progression-free survival (HR for disease progression or death = 0.45) and six-month overall survival (81% vs. 67%; death HR = 0.54; p=0.01) (PMID: 22663011). However, like other MEK inhibitors, the benefit of trametinib is limited by adverse reactions, most notably grade three or four rash and diarrhea (PMID: 22663011). Trametinib is not typically used as monotherapy for patients with BRAF V600K melanoma given its lower response rate compared to BRAF inhibitors and combined BRAF and MEK inhibitors. Patients previously treated with a RAF inhibitor appear to be less likely than untreated patients to respond to trametinib treatment (PMID: 22663011), and FDA guidelines state that trametinib as a monotherapy is not indicated for these patients. Dabrafenib and trametinib are FDA-approved as a combination therapy, which has superior clinical outcomes compared to dabrafenib or trametinib monotherapy (PMID: 25399551, 25265492). Additionally, patients with melanoma treated with dabrafenib and trametinib in both the neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings had improved survival over patients given standard of care (PMID: 29361468).',

In a randomized Phase III trial comparing vemurafenib (960 mg orally twice daily) with dacarbazine (1000 mg/m2 i.v. every 3 weeks) for treatment-naive, metastatic, BRAF V600E-mutant melanoma, vemurafenib was associated with better overall survival (median survival 13.6 months vs. 9.7 months; hazard ratio 0.70, p=.0008) and longer median progression-free survival (6.9 months vs. 1.6 months) (PMID: 24508103). Final overall survival data from the BRIM-3 study showed that the survival advantage of vemurafenib over dacarbazine persisted through the 4-year landmark, with survival rates for vemurafenib and dacarbazine at the 4-year landmark being 17.0% and 15.6%, respectively (PMID: 28961848).

Expression of this mutation in 293T cells demonstrated that this mutation is activating as measured by increased downstream ERK activation and increased transcription of downstream MAPK pathway transcriptional targets (e.g. ELK) compared to wildtype BRAF (PMID: 20735442). A patient with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring the BRAF V600G mutation had stable disease in response to treatment with vemutafenib, while a patient with sarcoma and a patient with esophagogastric cancer both harboring the BRAF V600G mutation had progressive disease in response to vemurafenib (PMID: 26287849).',

FDA approval of dabrafenib in combination with trametinib was based on results from an open-label Phase III study of combination therapy versus dabrafenib monotherapy in 247 patients with metastatic melanoma who were naive to treatment with BRAF inhibitors. Combined dabrafenib and trametinib, administered in full monotherapy doses, improved the response rate in patients with BRAF V600-mutant metastatic melanoma versus dabrafenib monotherapy (67% vs.51%; p\u003C0.002). However, median progression-free survival improved by only two weeks (9.3 months vs 8.8 months; HR = 0.75) compared with dabrafenib monotherapy (PMID: 23020132). Combination therapy is associated with less cutaneous toxicity than monotherapy, but systemic toxicity may be increased (PMID: 25287827, 25399551). Follow-up trials have demonstrated that all clinical measures inclusive of overall and median progression-free survival as well as objective response rates, median duration of response and number of patients with complete response favored patients treated with combination dabrafenib and trametinib, administered in full monotherapy doses, compared to either dabrafenib or vemurafenib monotherapy, including patients who previously progressed on BRAF inhibitor monotherapy (PMID: 25287827, 25399551, 25265492). Additionally, patients with melanoma treated with dabrafenib and trametinib in both the neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings have improved survival over patients given standard of care (PMID: 29361468, 28991513, 28891408). Promising clinical data has also suggested that addition of an immunotherapy agent to combination RAF and MEK inhibitor treatment may improve rate of overall response and duration of response in melanoma patients (PMID: 31171876, 31171879, 31171878).',

The Systemic Mastocytosis NCCN v2.2021 states that 90-95% of patients with AdvSM have a mutation at codon D816 of KIT. In the international, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase II PI0NEER study of avapritinib in 39 patients with indolent systemic mastocytosis (n=37 KIT D816V-positive), six out of ten patients in the 25mg avapritinib once daily cohort (n=10) cleared or had a >50% reduction in blood KIT D816V allele fraction (Abstract: Akin et al.

Often, this leads to the overexpression of EGFR protein and hyperactivation of downstream signaling through the MAPK pathway (PMID: 24120142, 10728703). EGFR amplification is found across various cancers, including lung adenocarcinoma, esophageal carcinoma and glioma (PMID: 25079552, 28052061, 24120142). In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrate that EGFR amplification in primary glioma sphere-forming cell samples results in sensitivity to the PARP inhibitor talazoparib as measured by decreased viability and reduced tumor growth in a xenograft model upon drug treatment (PMID: 31852834). Patients with non-small cell lung cancer who harbor amplification of wildtype or tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)-sensitive mutant EGFR have shown clinical benefit in response to EGFR TKIs (PMID: 30622811, 30284706). Additionally, EGFR amplification has been associated with sensitivity to HER2 inhibition with afatinib in HER2+ esophagogastric cancer (PMID: 30463996).

      'EGFR amplification results from the gain of extra copies of the EGFR gene on chromosome 7p11. Often, this leads to the overexpression of EGFR protein and hyperactivation of downstream signaling through the MAPK pathway (PMID: 24120142, 10728703). EGFR amplification is found across various cancers, including lung adenocarcinoma, esophageal carcinoma and glioma (PMID: 25079552, 28052061, 24120142). In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrate that EGFR amplification in primary glioma sphere-forming cell samples results in sensitivity to the PARP inhibitor talazoparib as measured by decreased viability and reduced tumor growth in a xenograft model upon drug treatment (PMID: 31852834). Patients with non-small cell lung cancer who harbor amplification of wildtype or tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)-sensitive mutant EGFR have shown clinical benefit in response to EGFR TKIs (PMID: 30622811, 30284706). Additionally, EGFR amplification has been associated with sensitivity to HER2 inhibition with afatinib in HER2+ esophagogastric cancer (PMID: 30463996). A patient with salivary gland cancer harboring high-level EGFR amplification had a durable, near-complete response to treatment with afatinib (Abstract: Lai et al.

However, median progression-free survival improved by only two weeks (9.3 months vs 8.8 months; HR = 0.75) compared with dabrafenib monotherapy (PMID: 23020132). Combination therapy is associated with less cutaneous toxicity than monotherapy, but systemic toxicity may be increased (PMID: 25287827, 25399551). Follow-up trials have demonstrated that all clinical measures inclusive of overall and median progression-free survival as well as objective response rates, median duration of response and number of patients with complete response favored patients treated with combination dabrafenib and trametinib, administered in full monotherapy doses, compared to either dabrafenib or vemurafenib monotherapy, including patients who previously progressed on BRAF inhibitor monotherapy (PMID: 25287827, 25399551, 25265492). Additionally, patients with melanoma treated with dabrafenib and trametinib in both the neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings have improved survival over patients given standard of care (PMID: 29361468, 28991513, 28891408). Promising clinical data has also suggested that addition of an immunotherapy agent to combination RAF and MEK inhibitor treatment may improve rate of overall response and duration of response in melanoma patients (PMID: 31171876, 31171879, 31171878).',

Combined dabrafenib and trametinib, administered in full monotherapy doses, improved the response rate in patients with BRAF V600-mutant metastatic melanoma versus dabrafenib monotherapy (67% vs.51%; p<0.002). However, median progression-free survival improved by only two weeks (9.3 months vs 8.8 months; HR = 0.75) compared with dabrafenib monotherapy (PMID: 23020132). Combination therapy is associated with less cutaneous toxicity than monotherapy, but systemic toxicity may be increased (PMID: 25287827, 25399551). Follow-up trials have demonstrated that all clinical measures inclusive of overall and median progression-free survival as well as objective response rates, median duration of response and number of patients with complete response favored patients treated with combination dabrafenib and trametinib, administered in full monotherapy doses, compared to either dabrafenib or vemurafenib monotherapy, including patients who previously progressed on BRAF inhibitor monotherapy (PMID: 25287827, 25399551, 25265492). Additionally, patients with melanoma treated with dabrafenib and trametinib in both the neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings have improved survival over patients given standard of care (PMID: 29361468, 28991513, 28891408). Promising clinical data has also suggested that addition of an immunotherapy agent to combination RAF and MEK inhibitor treatment may improve rate of overall response and duration of response in melanoma patients (PMID: 31171876, 31171879, 31171878).',

        'The combination of vemurafenib, an orally available kinse inhibitor of V600-mutant BRAF, and cobimetinib, an orally available kinase inhibitor of MEK1/2, is FDA-approved for the treatment of patients with BRAF V600-mutant metastatic or unresectable locally advanced melanoma. FDA approval was based on results from the randomized Phase III coBRIM trial of combined vemurafenib and cobimetinib versus vemurafenib and placebo in 495 patients with metastatic BRAF V600-mutant melanoma that demonstrated superior clinical benefit measures in the combination versus the control arm. Specifically, median progression-free survival was 9.9 months in the combination arm versus 6.2 months in the control arm (HR = 0.51), with a complete response rate of 10% versus 4%, respectively, and interim nine-month overall survival of 81% versus 73%, respectively (PMID: 25265494). Follow-up analysis of the coBRIM trial showed two-year overall survival was 48.3% in the combination group versus 38.0% in the monotherapy group (PMID: 27480103).',
